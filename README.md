# Passport.js Example

This example show how to use [Passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org) with Next.js. The example features cookie based authentication with username and password.

The example shows how to do a login, signup and logout; and to get the user info using a hook with [SWR](https://swr.now.sh).

A DB is not included. You can use any db you want and add it [here](/lib/user.js).

The login cookie is httpOnly, meaning it can only be accessed by the API, and it's encrypted using [@hapi/iron](https://hapi.dev/family/iron) for more security.
